## ✨ Features

- **Typesafe Provider and Decisions API** - New typesafe provider, `/v1/decisions` endpoint and `/typesafe` integration. Providers without native decision support now answer decision requests through forced tool-calling on their chat model, whether used as the primary or as a fallback. Probabilities are normalized to sum to exactly 1 and the chosen option must be the most likely one. Decision requests are priced from the datasheet and logged with their answers (#7355, #7361, #7384, #7440)
- **Provider-Level Session Affinity** - A session (from `x-bf-session-id` or the session header that Claude Code, Codex CLI or OpenCode already send) stays on the provider and key that last served it. Affinity only reorders the chain routing built and never restores a provider routing excluded. The logs UI shows it as a routing engine
- **Claude Opus 5.5 Support** - Computer use sends `computer_toolset_20260801` on the Anthropic API and Vertex, while Bedrock and Azure keep `computer_20251124`. `toolset_name` is carried on both halves of each call/result pair across typed, raw passthrough and streaming paths. Disabled thinking and forced tool choice are rejected for Opus 5.5+, and the datasheet `supports_reasoning_disable` field can override this (#7433, #7434, #7441)
- **Claude Code Auto-Mode Safeguards Passthrough** - `safeguards` and `safeguard_results` are forwarded byte-for-byte on requests, responses and stream events to the direct Anthropic provider and stripped on every other provider. The `dangerous-tool-use` and `auto-mode-classifier` betas are gated the same way. Unknown Anthropic SSE events are forwarded raw on the Anthropic passthrough (#7393, #7440)

## 🐞 Fixed

- **Kimi and DeepSeek with Claude Code** - Tool-schema regex patterns are rewritten (`\0` to `\x00`, lookaround assertions stripped) for Moonshot and DeepSeek models only. kimi-k3 on Bedrock no longer returns an empty stream, and every other model gets byte-identical schemas (#7430)
- **Anthropic Billing Header Leak** - Claude Code's `x-anthropic-billing-header` system block is removed at Messages ingress and restored only for Anthropic-family attempts, including fallbacks and alias targets, so it no longer pollutes GPT or Gemini prompts (#7431)
- **MCP Egress Proxy** - MCP HTTP/SSE connections honor `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY` and `NO_PROXY` again (broken since core v1.8.5). Link-local and unspecified destinations are refused before the proxy is dialed (#7437)
- **OpenAI `computer` Tool** - The bare `{"type":"computer"}` tool is no longer rewritten to `computer_use_preview`, which fixes computer use on GPT-6 Astra and GPT-5.6 (#7426) (thanks [@abhishekgahlot2](https://github.com/abhishekgahlot2)!)
- **Streaming Memory Leaks** - The request context is cancelled on every stream exit path, not only on write errors, which stops leaked disconnect watchers from pinning request contexts. `StripEmptyThinkingBlocks` rewrites the body once instead of once per block, and Anthropic beta-header gating no longer decodes the full request body (#7406)
- **Bedrock cachePoint Leak** - Bedrock `cachePoint` markers are stripped copy-on-write for non-Bedrock providers and kept for Bedrock fallbacks. The compat plugin no longer mutates the shared request. Nova reasoning signatures are stripped on the wire only (#7182)
- **Bedrock Empty JSON Keys** - Tool results containing an empty-string object key (such as Cursor's `list_directory`) are sent as text, so Converse no longer rejects them (#7396)
- **Bedrock cache_control on String Content** - InvokeModel keeps every `cache_control` when any message's content is a plain string (#7360) (thanks [@basil-k-aji-dev](https://github.com/basil-k-aji-dev)!)
- **Web Search Source Names** - Responses web search API sources keep their `name` and no longer emit an empty `url` (#7358) (thanks [@g-yixuan](https://github.com/g-yixuan)!)
- **Grok 4.7 xhigh Reasoning** - `xhigh` reasoning effort is no longer downgraded to `high` (#7403) (thanks [@nettee](https://github.com/nettee)!)
- **Allow-All Provider Access** - Virtual keys that allow every provider now list models from, and route to, every configured provider. The governance routing log names providers excluded for having no weight (#7375)
- **OpenAI Chat Stream Framing** - Bundled raw finish and usage frames on the OpenAI chat stream passthrough each get their own `data:` prefix (#7440)
- **Responses Deep Copy** - `DeepCopyResponsesMessage` now deep copies cache controls, provider-native parts, computer/MCP/code-interpreter tool fields and annotations, so copies no longer share pointers with the original (#7422)
- **Request Preparation Performance** - Responses requests are decoded once instead of several times, and the compat plugin clones only the fields it writes (#7412, #7097) (thanks [@G-XD](https://github.com/G-XD)!)

<Update label="Core" description="1.10.1">
- feat: typesafe provider, /v1/decisions endpoint, and decision emulation via forced tool-calling for providers without native decision support (#7355, #7361, #7384, #7440)
- feat: provider-level session affinity through the SessionAffinity seam, bound on request outcome
- feat: Claude Opus 5.5 computer_toolset_20260801 support with toolset_name round-trip, and disabled-thinking/forced-tool-choice gating overridable from the datasheet (#7433, #7434, #7441)
- feat: safeguards/safeguard_results passthrough for Claude Code auto-mode on direct Anthropic, stripped elsewhere; raw carrier for unknown Anthropic stream events (#7393, #7440)
- fix: rewrite tool-schema regex NUL escapes and lookarounds for Moonshot and DeepSeek models only (#7430)
- fix: strip Anthropic billing header at ingress and restore it only for Anthropic-family attempts (#7431)
- fix: honor HTTP_PROXY/HTTPS_PROXY/NO_PROXY for MCP connections with a pre-proxy link-local guard (#7437)
- fix: stop rewriting OpenAI `computer` tool to computer_use_preview (#7426) (thanks [@abhishekgahlot2](https://github.com/abhishekgahlot2)!)
- fix: linear StripEmptyThinkingBlocks and beta-header gating without full body decode (#7406)
- fix: strip Bedrock cachePoint markers copy-on-write for non-Bedrock providers, preserved for fallbacks (#7182)

- fix: deep copy extended Responses fields in DeepCopyResponsesMessage (#7422)
- fix: frame bundled OpenAI chat stream raw frames with a data prefix each (#7440)
- fix: stream errors after startup events (response.created, in_progress, empty role delta) now reach retry and fallback for OpenAI models on every host (OpenAI, Bedrock, Bedrock Mantle, Vertex, custom providers), not only Azure; an overloaded stream no longer reaches the client as an error when a fallback is configured
- [perf]: avoid redundant JSON decoding in Responses request preparation
- [fix]: preserve xhigh reasoning effort for Grok 4.7 [@nettee](https://github.com/nettee)
- [fix]: Bedrock InvokeModel keeps cache_control when any message's content is a plain string. BedrockMessage.Content is typed as content blocks, so one bare string anywhere in messages[] failed the standard unmarshal and diverted the whole request into the AI21 string fallback, which rebuilt the messages without calling applyMessageContentCacheControl. Every cache_control in the request was dropped rather than only the one on the string message, so prompt caching went off silently with just the system cachePoint surviving. The fallback now makes the same translation the standard path does (#7336) [@basil-k-aji-dev](https://github.com/basil-k-aji-dev)
- [fix]: web search action sources round-trip their name and no longer fabricate an empty url. OpenAI Responses web search can return specialized API sources (`{"type":"api","name":"oai-weather"}`) that carry a name and no URL; the typed source schema only modeled type and a required url, so decode dropped name and re-encode emitted "url":"", and the OpenAI request-side source sanitization rebuilt sources without name. url is now omitempty and name survives both the schema round-trip and the sanitization path (#7356) [@g-yixuan](https://github.com/g-yixuan)
