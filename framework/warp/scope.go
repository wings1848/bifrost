// Query scope: which slice of the deployment's traffic a question is about.
//
// This is a *precision* mechanism, not an access control. Row-level access is
// already enforced by framework/queryscope, which the store applies to every
// read regardless of what Warp asks for - so widening a query can never surface
// data the caller could not fetch from the logs API directly. What this solves
// is a different failure: on a deployment serving many teams and customers,
// "what did we spend last week?" has several correct answers, and silently
// picking the widest one produces a confident number about the wrong thing.
//
// The rule is:
//
//   - When the caller has an identity, their own traffic is the default. That is
//     the question people usually mean, and it is the one they can always check.
//   - When there is no identity, there is no sensible default, so Warp is told
//     to ask which team, customer or business unit is meant before querying.
//   - An explicit scope in the question always wins over the default. Asking
//     about another team is a legitimate question; the store decides whether the
//     answer is allowed.
