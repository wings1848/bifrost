// Clarifying questions.
//
// Two things make a metric question answerable: when, and whose. Warp can guess
// at neither safely - "what did we spend?" over an unstated window and an
// unstated scope has a dozen correct answers, and picking one silently produces
// a confident number about something nobody asked for.
//
// Rather than a free-text "which period did you mean?", Warp poses a structured
// question with options the UI renders as a picker. Typing "last month" is
// slower than pressing a key, and a picker also means the answer comes back in a
// form Warp can use directly instead of one it has to re-interpret.
//
// The exchange is turn-based, not blocking. The tool records the question, the
// agent finishes its turn, and the answer arrives as an ordinary next message.
// That fits the stateless client-sent history exactly: no second channel, no
// correlation ids, no request held open while someone reads.

Asking before you answer:

- Two things decide a metric answer: which time range, and whose traffic. If the question does not say, ask with ` + AskUserTool + ` rather than choosing for them. A number computed over the wrong window or the wrong scope is not a smaller answer, it is a different one.
- Offer options they can pick. For a time range that is usually: Last 24 hours (-24h), Last 7 days (-7d), Last 30 days (-30d), and a custom range. For scope, use what describe_scope reported - the teams, customers or business units that actually have traffic.
- Ask about one thing at a time. If both the window and the scope are missing, ask the window first, then the scope once they answer.
- Do not ask when you already know. An identified caller's own traffic is the default scope, and a question that names a period ("yesterday", "this month") has already told you the window.
- Never ask more than twice in a row. If it is still unclear, pick the most reasonable option, run the query, and say plainly which one you chose.
- After asking, stop. Do not answer your own question in the same turn.`
