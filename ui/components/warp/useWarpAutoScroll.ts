/**
 * Keeps the transcript pinned to its newest content.
 *
 * The obvious version - a sentinel div and scrollIntoView in an effect keyed on
 * the message count - does not work here, and the reason is worth stating: the
 * effect runs when React commits, but almost nothing in an Warp turn has its
 * final height by then. Tool rows appear one at a time as steps finish, the
 * markdown renderer is lazy-loaded behind Suspense so an answer commits as a
 * fallback and grows when Shiki arrives, and tables reflow after that. Scrolling
 * to the bottom of a body that has not finished growing leaves the newest
 * content off-screen - which looks exactly like the auto-scroll not firing.
 *
 * So the trigger is size, not renders. A ResizeObserver on the content watches
 * the transcript's real height and re-pins on every change, whoever caused it -
 * which covers each tool row as it lands, not just completed messages.
 *
 * The nodes arrive through callback refs rather than ref objects. The panel
 * renders a "not configured" placeholder while its config query is in flight, so
 * on first commit there is no transcript to observe at all; an effect holding
 * ref objects would find nothing, bail, and never run again once the real
 * transcript replaced the placeholder. Callback refs put the nodes in state, so
 * the effect re-runs the moment they exist.
 *
 * The pin releases as soon as the reader scrolls up. Dragging someone back down
 * mid-sentence because a token arrived is worse than not following at all, so
 * following is a mode they stay in until they leave it, and re-enter by
 * returning to the bottom.
