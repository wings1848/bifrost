 * is a different one. Offering options rather than asking someone to type is
 * both faster and gives Warp an answer it can use directly instead of one it has
 * to re-interpret.
 *
 * Skip is always available. A question you cannot decline is a wall, and Warp
 * can proceed on its own judgement as long as it says what it assumed.
