/**
 * Wraps the app's content column so Warp can dock beside it.
 *
 * The dock narrows the page rather than floating over it, which is the whole
 * point: you ask Warp about the chart you are looking at, so the chart has to
 * stay readable. The topbar sits inside the left column and narrows with the
 * content.
 *
 * The width is fixed rather than draggable. A resizable split was tried first
 * and opened as an unusable ~80px sliver: the panel group sizes in percentages
 * of a parent whose width is itself established by the sidebar's flex layout,
 * and the two did not agree on the available space. A fixed column has no such
 * dependency, and a chat panel has one sensible width anyway.
 *
 * This sits below the topbar, not around it, so opening the dock never changes
 * the topbar's width. Only the content region splits, and page height is
 * untouched - so --app-topbar-height and --app-content-viewport stay correct.
